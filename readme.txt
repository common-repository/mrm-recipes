== Description ==
Now you can automatically add your recipes to MyRecipeMagic.com with the updated Word Press plugin. No more copying and pasting, opening two windows to make sure you get it right, finding time to get all the recipes loaded when you load your new posts. We do it all for you!! JUST ONE CLICK and your recipes are added auto"magically" to MyRecipeMagic with all your ingredients. The magic button is also added to make it easier for your followers.

More Traffic - Less Effort

The plugin is designed to add traffic to your site by giving your recipes more exposure to recipe lovers everywhere. It leaves the directions off of the recipe and requires visitors to go to your site to get the full recipe. With millions of viewers each month, you will start to see an increase in your traffic as you add more recipes to MyRecipeMagic.

Plugin Requirements

* Must be an active MyRecipeMagic User.
* Must use a recipe formatting plugin - for now Meal Planner Pro or Easy Recipe.
* Must click ONE box for every recipe when you post it.
* Must be willing to accept more traffic to your site.

== Installation ==

You can install the MRM Recipes Plugin either from Wordpress admin panel or do it manually by following the steps below:

1. Unzip the archive and put the 'mrm_recipes' folder into your plugins folder (/wp-content/plugins/).
2. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu.

== MyRecipeMagic Plugin Usage ==

1) Once you have activated the MRM plugin, you will need to enter the MRM username and magic button position from the settings page. 
You can access the Plugin settings page in WordPress admin by selecting MRM Settings from the left hand menu.

Note: MRM username is required to use the MRM Plugin. The Plugin will not work without entering the MRM Username.

2) After entering the username in the MRM settings, you can begin sending recipes to MRM for any new post.

3) Enter your recipe, including the recipe detail in the Meal Planner Pro or Easy Recipe plugins. Then click the box to "Add this recipe to MRM", which is usually at the bottom of the post entry page.  Then publish your recipe on your site.

4) Your recipe is then sent to MRM for approval. Once it is approved (usually within 24 hours) you can add it to a collection, add tags and share it from MRM.
